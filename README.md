Lately there's been quite a bit of #superfishy stuff coming to the surface... floating to the surface, as it were.

We've been noticing many javascripties that run from obscurly mysterious to astonishingly evil. So we began collecting them, to share amoungst the staff... and it turned into a "thing," as they say.

Specifically alot of browser extensions loading .js horrors that do terrible, terrible things behind the scenes. Snapshot their XML, stick it here, and let's clean out some of that crap.

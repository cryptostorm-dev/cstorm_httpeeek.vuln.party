Lately there's been quite a bit of #superfishy stuff coming to the surface... floating to the surface, as it were.

We've been noticing many javascripties that run from obscurly mysterious to astonishingly evil. So we began collecting them, to share amoungst the staff... and it turned into a "thing," as they say.

Here is that thing. Collect your most evil-genius-y .js baddies here.

Cheers!
